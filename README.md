# SIH2022
This project was presented in Smart India Hackathon 2022 and my team - Out Of Box Thinkers won 1st prize. The problem statement for the project was KH1155 - To maintain and enjoy Healthy relationship with others.
We hardly pay heed to our non-verbal skills and are unaware of our voice, facial expressions, hand gestures, eye contact & speech rate while communicating with others
To cater this, we have come up with a solution that provides an interface to the user (school or college student) to record his/her answers in textual or audio-video formats to the situational questions asked as per their age group
Based on these answers we extract various features & perform facial emotion analysis, hand gesture analysis, speech rate analysis, eye movement analysis and calculation of loudness & pitch of voice.
The predicted results (in textual and graphical format will not only help us to understand our communication and interpersonal skills but also will help to improve trust, empathy, healthy relationships and conflict resolution with each other.
